what if you have a bodyline under a empty folder?'

# Docstosaurus

Write a nested list and Docstosaurus will convert it to a hierarchy directoiy structure, files and their content.

By default, Docusaurus will remove the number prefix from the doc id, title, label, and URL paths.

## Directory Structure

- This line becomes a directory named after this very line
  - This becomes a file/folder whose name would start with This becomes a file/folder
  - File here or folder. If a line has no children, it becomes a file., unless you check allow empty folders
  - Another folder, under /This line becomes/
    - This line becomes a file. The lines on the last layer become empty files.
    - What Really Files and folders are named after the line they represent, in this case, **What Really Files.md**
    - Unless specified, files are `.MD`
  - Back to file, it has no children and is therefore a leaf
- New Folder!
  - Look At all these folders
  - I love sub folders
    - Files are good too
    - 1234 You can have digits in your titles! this is a file @#$%^&*()<>? are okay
    - By default files are dot em dee
  - Wow sub folder
    - Files are good too, this file will end up something Files_are_good.MD 
    - Here is a a file called “hiworld.txt” it will have content written in it.
    - **Lets write in this file**
    - **HELLO WORLD**
    - **All 4 of these bold lines are INSIDE the file. Anything bold gets written INSIDE the file. Bold on the list is Content in the file.**
    - **If you want something in your file to actully be bold** just use this instead **#@ipsom dorum#@** becomes bold.
      - **You can even put nested lists INSIDE of files!!!  just make it bold!**
    - What a time to be alive! This is a new empty file! “Specifyname.lol”
    - So long as it's “something.dot.something.in.quotes”

  Bullet Points, Numbers, !Letters, !Roman Numbers, Tabs, spaces, or indent. 

##WORDS

node = a line in the list

leaf = file = a node with no children

brach = direictoy = folder

parent

child

children

sibling

deepest layer = no other lines have greater indent

deepest level

hiearrachy

fodler strucutre

nested list

root = base_dir = install folder

indent = number of spaces = leading whitepace










## Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right



## Uxd h2 and h3 headings syntax in your bolded text, and it will be in the Docusaurous TOC by default.
internal links for indivual pages, a table of contents for that file will be generated on the top right and the **internal links can be nested too!** we love nests! use markdown syntax for h1 and h2 headers
